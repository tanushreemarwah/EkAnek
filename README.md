This assignment has been made using Ruby on Rails.

Ruby Version: ruby 2.3.0 Features/Functionality:

1. Sign Up or Log In as a user with email and password
2. A logged in user can add a new item, specify its title and description. Also, a file can be added by clicking on the 'choose file' button.
3. A logged in user can view only the files he has added, not the files other users have added. Therefore, the item list is private.
